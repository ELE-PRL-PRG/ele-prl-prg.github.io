                            <p>Together with Noble and Potter, we proposed a concept that became known as Ownership Types, and I was one of the designers of the Thorn language.

                        <p>My name is Tomas Kalibera and I work on the R language.  I first encountered it while learning statistics during my doctoral studies. 
                        My dissertation was about statistical methods in regression benchmarking. At that time, R was a bit slow (and still is), 
                        but extremely useful and growing in popularity. During my postdoc at Purdue University in the USA. I worked on Ovm, a real-time Java virtual machine, 
                        where I enjoyed low-level programming of the real-time garbage collector, interrupt handling, or support for embedded OS.</p>  
                        
                        <p>Finally, I switched teams, and is now working on R itself. Making R better is a unique challenge, and one that I am enjoying. 
                        R has a massive codebase of applications that use every corner case of the language. The VM For R can be changed as long as "it makes sense" 
                        and it does not break applications.  This is completely different from building a language ecosystem from scratch or from improving an implementation of a 
                        language that has a specification. </p>

                            <p>My name is Filip Krikava. I am a member of the ELE team currently exiled in Boston. I did my doctoral studies at the French national centre of scientific research (CNRS) 
                            in the I3S laboratory in Nice Sophia-Antipolis. I did a postdoc at INRIA in the Spirals Team. My primary research interests were in self-adaptive software systems. 
                            These systems are characterized by the ability to continuously operate under varying runtime conditions.  I also worked on domain-specific languages for consistency 
                            checking and transformation of software models.</p>

                            <p>Before working as a researcher, I worked as a software engineer in many different parts of the world. After leaving the Czech Republic for more than a decade, 
                            I’ve finally came back and decided to joined FIT in the software engineering department  ,and later the PRL group. Currently, I'm interested in various aspects of 
                            programming languages in particular in static and dynamic program analysis. Most recently I have been working on dynamic tracing in R, but I look forward for program 
                            analysis of modeling languages.</p>

                            <p>My name is Alena Sochůrková, I come from a small village in central Bohemia. Growing up I liked reading sci-fi and writing to the point I wanted to become a writer and aimed for humanities. 
                            However, I got interested in cyberpunk and computers. Since I was good at math, my choice shifted to natural sciences. Learning how computers work and how to make them tick was exciting. 
                            I took a part-time job as a programmer. In my last semester of masters, I attended a presentation by Prof. Vítek about the ELE grant and it got me further interested in programming languages.</p>

                            <p>The word “research” is still confusing. It is so different from any of my previous stages of education, but I hope to make a contribution, especially in the field of security 
                            of programming languages.</p>
                            
                            <p>I will visit our Boston lab in the spring  I am excited to meet some people I met briefly at ECOOP conference in Rome last summer. I hope my stay in the US will be fruitful and, 
                            I cannot wait to visit the New England Aquarium.</p>

                            <p>My passion for computing developed once late. Growing up I had no appreciation for what a computer could do, but after writing my first program , 
                            I was completely mesmerised and  switched to study computer science. Throughout my studies I was enamored by the expressive power of the computer languages I used. 
                            I viewed them no differently to the many natural languages used all over the world. The possibility for ambiguity and the way a language would dictate how you thought 
                            about a problem lead me to a PhD in this field. After earning my doctorate, I joined the Programming Research Lab at Northeastern University, where I was able to work alongside amazing researchers. 
                            I was able to learn many topics that were previously unknown to me, such as virtual machines, and just-in compilers.</p>

                            <p>My name is Konrad Siek. I am a new member of the ELE team.</p> 

                            <p>I defended my PhD thesis at the Distributed Systems Research Group at Poznań
                            University of Technology at the beginning of January 2017. My research focus
                            were distributed pessimistic transactional memory systems and their safety
                            properties. While working on TM, I developed a passion for making concurrency
                            easier for application programmers, which requires automatization and
                            transparency. This naturally led me to get interested in programming language
                            research.</p>
                            
                            <p>I joined the PRL group in January 2017, where I am looking forward to working
                            in programming language research. Since the field is new to me, everything is
                            alien and fascinating, and I have a lot to learn. I am currently discovering
                            the secrets of compilation, static analysis, and I plan to work on the R
                            language. In the long term I hope to be able to merge my penchant for
                            concurrency and my new-found relish for programming languages into a
                            contribution to either field.</p>
                            
                            <p>I was always interested in programming, but before I embarked on a research
                            career in CS, I got a B.A. in English philology and taught English. I also
                            plied my trade as a software developer for a year.</p>
